# Pascal's Triangle

## Description
Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept that consists of a triangular array of numbers. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top, and each subsequent row is constructed by adding a 1 to the beginning and end of the previous row.

This repository contains an implementation of Pascal's Triangle in Python. It allows you to generate and display Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.

## Features
- Generate Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows
- Display the generated triangle in a user-friendly format
## Example
Here's an example of generating Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows:
